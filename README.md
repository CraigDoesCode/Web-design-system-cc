# Build a Website Design System
### Project Goals
In this project, I am building my own basic design system for a website. In essence, I am building a website to help you build MORE websites in the future! On my site, Iâ€™ll collect all the colors, fonts, and some of the repeating styles.

### Aims:
 - To learn more about colors that work together on a site
 - To explore bootstrap
 - To deepen my understanding of HTML and CSS Structure

# My Process

### Built With
 - HTML 5
 - CSS
 - Bootstrap

### What I Learned
I learned alot about structuring collumns and rows to get my desired result using bootstrap. I also got a better understanding of what styling is already acounted for in bootstrap and what a may need to use ```!important``` on to take effect.

I found out how to find the names of colours, convert RGB to HEX and find colours using a digital colour meter. Explored different methods of styling and importing fonts.
### Continued Development
- Lean abous Sass
- expand bootstap knowledge
